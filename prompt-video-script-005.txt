Visual Prompt Template:

Scene 1: The Problem or Challenge (Pixel Art)
"A pixel art scene shows a [user type derived from description] in a [setting derived from description] surrounded by [relevant tools, objects, or symbols from the description]. The user looks [emotion derived from description, e.g., frustrated, overwhelmed, tired], and their environment reflects [key challenge described, e.g., cluttered, chaotic, glitching data]. Subtle animations, such as [flickering screens, floating icons, glitch effects], emphasize their emotional state. The colors are [palette reflecting challenge, e.g., muted blues, grays, or purples], reinforcing a mood of [emotion, e.g., tension, confusion, or frustration]."

Transition Animation:
"A soft pixelated glow appears from [key object/tool], and the scene starts to shift subtly with warmer colors and calming animations, hinting at a solution."

Scene 2: Discovery and Transformation (Pixel Art)
"The scene brightens into a vibrant pixel art environment. The user is now interacting confidently with [tool/platform/interface derived from description], which is represented by [key elements, e.g., glowing panels, organized dashboards, interactive animations]. The user's body language shows [emotion, e.g., confidence, focus, joy], and their surroundings now reflect clarity and order with a warm palette of [inviting colors, e.g., yellows, greens, light blues]. Subtle animated effects like [progress bars filling, sparkles glowing, smooth transitions] highlight the transformation. The user smiles, symbolizing a sense of accomplishment and control."

Ending Animation:
"The camera zooms into the glowing interface or tool, showing a polished pixel art representation of the platform. The screen holds briefly before fading into soft pixelated sparkles."
