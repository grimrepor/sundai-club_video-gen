Example Output for Pixel Art Video Prompt:
"A pixel art character sits surrounded by glitching screens, chaotic notifications, and swirling pixelated symbols. Their posture is slouched, eyes tired, and faint flickering question marks hover above their head. The room is dark, painted in muted blues and grays, and faint glitch effects ripple across the screens. The character scrolls endlessly on a central glowing screen, their frustration palpable.

Suddenly, one screen begins to emit a warm pixelated glow, spreading across the desk and lighting up the character's face. The chaotic screens reorganize into clean glowing panels, bright animations, and smooth dashboards in vibrant yellows, greens, and light blues. The character's posture shiftsâ€”they now sit upright, focused, and confident. They interact with the glowing interface, tapping buttons that animate with smooth checkmarks and soft glowing effects. The background feels lighter, with faint pixelated stars gently twinkling.

In the final moment, the camera zooms into the central screen, where glowing visuals fade into a warm pixelated light, leaving behind soft sparkling particles in the background as the scene gently fades to black."
