Goal:

Use the extracted insights to create a single cohesive pixel art video prompt that captures the emotional arc and visual storytelling requirements.
Ensure clarity, strong visual metaphors, and no text overlays in the video.
Prompt for Step 2:

*"Using the insights given, create a single cohesive Pixel Art Video Prompt for Sora:

The prompt must include:

Scene 1 (Problem Phase): Represent the emotional challenge with clear pixel art visuals and animations.
Transition Animation: A smooth transition that hints at a solution (e.g., a glow, a spark effect).
Scene 2 (Solution Phase): Show the transformation clearly, with brighter visuals and engaging pixel animations.
Ending Animation: A focused shot, such as a glowing interface or central character interaction, fading smoothly to pixelated sparkles or light.
Avoid any use of text in the video. Rely on expressive visuals, strong emotional cues, and smooth pixel animations to tell the story effectively."*

Example Output for Pixel Art Sora Prompt:
"Scene 1: A pixel art character sits in front of a chaotic wall of glitching screens, endlessly scrolling through fragmented notifications. The screens flicker, icons float in disarray, and the characterâ€™s expression shows frustration and exhaustion. The background is dark, dominated by cool blues and grays. Tiny pixel animations of flickering lights and floating question marks emphasize confusion.
Transition Animation: One screen starts glowing softly, and the chaotic visuals begin to fade slightly as warm light spreads outward.

Scene 2: The screens now display an organized, glowing dashboard filled with smooth animated panels. The character sits upright, their posture confident, and they interact with the glowing interface. Smooth pixel animations show progress bars filling up, checkmarks appearing, and subtle sparkles highlighting key actions. The room is now lit with warm yellows, greens, and light blues. The background feels calm and inviting, and the character smiles, radiating satisfaction and clarity.

Ending Animation: The camera zooms into the central glowing dashboard, where a faint sparkle animation highlights the glowing interface before fading gently to black."
